# WeatherApp

A simple weather application created using Angular 5 (CLI), SASS, RxJS and the Open Weather api (https://openweathermap.org/api).

Users enter a city in the search bar to find the current temperature and weather type of that city.

## Getting started

After cloning the repository run `npm install` to download the required node modules.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Built with
* Angular 5 (https://angular.io/) - JS framework.
* NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package manager.
* Open Weather (https://openweathermap.org/api) - Current weather data.
